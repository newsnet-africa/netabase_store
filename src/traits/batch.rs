//! Batching abstraction for efficient bulk operations
//!
//! This module provides traits for performing batch operations across different
//! backend implementations. Batching is crucial for performance when inserting
//! or updating multiple records.

/// A batch operation builder for accumulating database operations.
///
/// This trait provides a unified interface for building batch operations
/// across different database backends (sled, redb, etc.).
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// * `D` - The definition type (wraps all models in the schema)
/// * `M` - The model type for this batch
///
/// # Design
///
/// Different backends have different batching mechanisms:
///
/// - **Sled**: Uses `sled::Batch` for atomic operations
/// - **Redb**: Uses `WriteTransaction` for ACID transactions
///
/// This trait abstracts these differences to provide a consistent API.
///
/// # Example Flow
///
/// ```ignore
/// let mut batch = store.batch_builder();
/// batch.put(user1)?;
/// batch.put(user2)?;
/// batch.remove(old_user_id)?;
/// batch.commit()?;  // All operations applied atomically
/// ```
