//! # Netabase Dependencies
//!
//! This crate provides hygienic re-exports of all dependencies used by the Netabase macros.
//! It ensures that procedural macros can reference external dependencies without requiring
//! users to manually import them.
//!
//! This crate is an implementation detail and should not be used directly by end users.

pub mod __private {
    //! Re-exports of all dependencies used by generated macro code.
    //! This ensures macro hygiene - users don't need to manually import these dependencies.
    //!
    //! Private re-exports for macro hygiene. Do not use directly.
    //!
    //! All Netabase macros automatically use these dependencies, making them completely
    //! hygienic. You can use `#[derive(NetabaseModel)]` without any manual imports!
